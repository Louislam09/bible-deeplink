# Santa Escritura Deep Link Gateway  

This repository hosts a redirection page for deep linking into the **Santa Escritura** app. The page allows users to open the app directly from social media or other shared links using a custom URL scheme (`sb-rv60`). If the app is not installed, users will be redirected to the app's download page.  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features  
- Seamlessly redirect users to the **Santa Escritura** app using deep links (`sb-rv60://`).  
- Automatically fallback to the app's store page if the app is not installed.  
- Easy to share on social media and other platforms.  

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works  
1. When a user clicks the shared link, the page tries to open the app using the deep link: `sb-rv60://`.  
2. If the app is not installed, it redirects the user to the Play Store or App Store.
